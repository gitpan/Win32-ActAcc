NAME
    Win32::ActAcc - `Active Accessibility' for task automation, GUI testing

SYNOPSIS
    Win32::ActAcc gives Perl scripts free run of the Active Accessibility
    client API; IAccessible; and ``WinEvents''.

    Active Accessibility lets Perl scripts see what's on the screen, even when
    programs use ``custom controls'', lightweight (drawn) controls that are
    not technically windows, and the like: VB for example.

    You'll want to additionally use Win32::GuiTest, and other Win32 modules,
    if you want your script to click, type, manipulate the clipboard, etc.

     use Win32::OLE;
     use Win32::ActAcc;
     Win32::OLE->Initialize(); 

     # Start navigating window tree at its root -- the Desktop.
     $accObj = Desktop();
     @childAccObjs = $accObj->AccessibleChildren();

     $name = $accObj->get_accName();
     $rolename = Win32::ActAcc::GetRoleText($accObj->get_accRole());

    For full documentation, refer to ActAcc.html inside the zip.

INSTALLATION
  Installation from source code

     perl makefile.pl
     nmake 
     nmake install
     nmake test

    Yes, you have to install it before you test it. Otherwise it can't find
    its DLL. Probably someone will figure out how to fix this.

    Prerequisites:

    *   You may need Visual C++ 6.0 SP 4. The C/C++ part of Win32::ActAcc
        might not be portable to other compilers.

    *   You need the July 2000 "Platform SDK". Earlier versions of the Active
        Accessibility SDK could give problems compiling.

    *   The test suite requires Notepad.exe on the path. Also, it requires
        Win32::GuiTest.

    *   The Eliza-AOLInstantMessenger sample requires up-to-date HTML parsing
        modules. It will tell you if yours are missing or out-of-date.

  Installation for ActivePerl users (PPM)

    ActivePerl users can install Win32::ActAcc using PPM.

    1   Unzip the zip (Win32-ActAcc-n.n.zip). Make sure your unzip program
        preserved the directory tree: for example, you should see
        Win32-ActAcc.tar.gz in an "x86" subdirectory under the directory that
        contains ActAcc.html (the documentation).

    2   Open a command prompt window.

    3   In the command prompt, "cd" to the directory that contains
        ActAcc.html.

    4   In the command prompt, issue the following command.

         ppm install --location=. Win32-ActAcc

    To check the installation, you may try aaDigger.pl. The test suite (nmake
    test) doesn't seem to work if you do the ppm installation.

  Files Installed

    *   In bin: aaDigger.bat and aaDigger.pl, aaEvents.bat and aaEvents.pl,
        aaWhereAmI.bat and aaWhereAmI.pl

    *   In site\lib\Win32: aaDigger.pl, aaEvents.pl, aaWhereAmI.pl, ActAcc.pm,
        ActAcc.pod
