NAME
    Win32::ActAcc - an Active Accessibility client for Perl

SYNOPSIS
     use Win32::OLE;
     use Win32::GuiTest;
     use Win32::ActAcc;
     Win32::OLE->Initialize();  # Active Accessibility is based on COM

     my $hwnd_desktop = Win32::GuiTest::GetDesktopWindow();
     my $ao = AccessibleObjectFromWindow($hwnd_desktop);

     @ch = $ao->AccessibleChildren(); # returns list of accessible objects

     $name = $ao->get_accName();
     $rolename = Win32::ActAcc::GetRoleText($ao->get_accRole());

INSTALLATION
     perl makefile.pl
     nmake install
     nmake test

    Yes, 'install' before 'test'; otherwise the event-hook DLL won't be found.
    Surely there is a way to fix this.

    You need the July 2000 "Platform SDK". Earlier versions of the Active
    Accessibility SDK could give problems compiling. I compiled ActAcc using
    Visual C++ 6.0 SP 4.

    The test suite requires Notepad.exe on the path.

    In addition to the usual files for Perl extensions, the Makefile builds
    ActAccEM.DLL to capture WinEvents. It puts this DLL in a certain location
    in the Perl installation tree, which you can learn as follows:

     perl -e "use Config; print $Config{'scriptdirexp'}"

    Unfortunately, it is not under the 'site' branch of the tree. Someone with
    a deep and nuanced understanding of MakeMaker might help us here. To be
    proper, perhaps 'nmake' should put ActAccEM.DLL in the 'blib' tree, and
    perhaps 'nmake install' should put it in the 'site' tree.
