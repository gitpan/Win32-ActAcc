<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>aaDigger is a utility with which you can ``drill down'' through the
hierarchy of Active Accessibility objects.  The Desktop is at the root of the tree.</P>
<P>Use aaDigger when writing Active Accessibility scripts.
aaDigger helps you figure out how to make your scripts relate to 
the ``real world'' on your computer's screen.</P>

 aaDigger - Traverse window hierarchy</PRE>
<PRE>
 Windows shown as: role:name {state,(location),id,hwnd}
 Commands:
   99      - expand window by number (specify number from the list)
   ..      - go 'up' one level, to parent of current window
   /regexp - find children matching regexp
   tree    - display children hierarchically
   all     - expand list to include invisible children

<P>
<H2><A NAME="windows and clients">Windows and Clients</A></H2>
<P>Using aaDigger, you will note that objects whose role is 'window', 
generally have children in roles 'client' and 'title bar', among others.
(The 'client' area is where applications do their creative work.)</P>
<P>Accordingly, when you run aaDigger and it starts off at the Desktop-window,
your first drill-down takes you to the Desktop-client.  Within the
Desktop-client, you will find the windows for your applications -- as
well as the system tray.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="aadigger commands">aaDigger Commands</A></H2>
<P>aaDigger is command-driven.  You type in a command when aaDigger 
displays its prompt:</P>
<PRE>
 ?</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="drill down by objectnumber">Drill down by object-number</A></H3>
<P>Type the number of an object (as shown in aaDigger's object list) 
to ``drill down'' and observe the children of that object.</P>
<P>The object that defines the context of the list is shown with
the following attributes.  (Most objects do not define any of these.)</P>
<PRE>

<P>The children are shown in the form</P>
<PRE>
 role:name {state,(location),id,hwnd}</PRE>
<P>You can find more about all of these object traits in the Active Accessibility documentation.</P>
<P><STRONG>role</STRONG>, e.g., 'window', 'client', 'title bar', reflects
the Active Accessibility object taxonomy and supplants
the Win32 notion of ``window class''.</P>
<P><STRONG>name</STRONG> is how the object identifies itself.  Some 
objects steal the name of their parent or of a certain child.
Others change their name dynamically to reflect what the user 
is doing.  Some objects have no name.</P>
<P><STRONG>state</STRONG> is a set of state-bits, such as sizeable+moveable+focusable.</P>
<P><STRONG>location</STRONG> is the (left, top, width, height) of the object.  
The origin (0,0) is at the screen's upper left.</P>
<P><STRONG>hwnd</STRONG> is the result of calling WindowFromAccessibleObject.  Not
all accessible objects correspond to ``windows'' in the HWND sense.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="up (..)">Up (..)</A></H3>
<P>Move from a child object to its parent.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="search (/regexp)">Search (/regexp)</A></H3>
<P>Recursively find all children whose name matches the regexp.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="tree">Tree</A></H3>
<P>Shows the object's children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.</P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="all (show hidden objects)">All (Show hidden objects)</A></H3>
<P>Expands the scope of the numbered object list so it includes 
objects that do have the 'invisible' state bit.</P>
<P>``All'' is not sticky.  Next time you navigate (using a number or ..), 
you will once more see only the visible objects.
